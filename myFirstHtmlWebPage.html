    <h1><em>The Minimalist Web</em>: Crafting Pages with Only the Basics</h1>
    <p>

        In a world where websites are loaded with flashy animations, 
        heavy scripts, and high-resolution images, the art of building a 
        <em>pure, lightweight</em> webpage is nearly forgotten. 
        This article explores the charm and power of HTML’s 
        <mark>simplest tags</mark>.

    <h2>The Back-to-Basics Movement</h2>
    <p>
        Back in the early days of the internet, webpages were nothing more than 
        plain text, sprinkled with <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> styles. 
        The focus was on the <strong>content</strong>, not the decoration.  
        In many ways, this was the <em>golden age</em> of readability.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> language itself 
        was designed for structure — headings, paragraphs, and semantic meaning.  
        E = mc<sup>2</sup> still looks good without a single pixel of CSS, 
        and H<sub>2</sub>O remains as clear as ever.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Strip It Down?</h2>
    <p>
        There’s a quiet beauty in simplicity. Without distractions, 
        readers focus on the words.  
        <q>Minimalism is not the lack of something, it’s the perfect amount of something,</q> 
        as a famous designer once said.
    </p>
    <p>
        Removing images and heavy layouts means faster load times, 
        better accessibility, and even nostalgia for the 
        <del>chaotic</del> <ins>simpler</ins> internet days.
    </p>

    <h2>Magazine-Style Sections</h2>
    <p>
        Just like in a printed magazine, articles can be divided with 
        <u>bold headings</u> and subtle separators.  
        Think of <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> as the thin line between chapters, 
        and headings as your section titles.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can even keep a “side note” feel with <small>smaller text</small> 
        for author comments or additional reading hints.
    </p>

    <h2>A Practical Demonstration</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine we are describing a recipe in this minimal style:
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 1: Mix 250g of flour with H<sub>2</sub>O until smooth.  
        Step 2: Heat at 180<sup>°</sup>C for 30 minutes.  
        Step 3: <del>Serve cold</del> <ins>Serve warm</ins> for best taste.
    </p>
    <p>
        Code snippet: <code>temperature = 180; // degrees Celsius</code>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Closing Thought</h2>
    <p>
        Stripping a webpage down to its <strong>bare essentials</strong> 
        is not just a design choice — it’s a statement.  
        It says: <q>The words matter more than the wrapping.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        So the next time you open a code editor, try creating a page 
        with nothing but <em>headings</em>, <em>paragraphs</em>, 
        and <em>text formatting</em>.  
        You might just rediscover the timeless elegance of the early web.
